A solar flare is a sudden powerful burst of energy on the Sunâ€™s surface, often accompanied by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).

To explore basic physics of particle acceleration and explosive energy release in solar flares, NASA mission RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) was launched on February 5, 2002 and decomissioned on August 16, 2018.

The raw data file has 121,180 observations. The cleaned data frame has 39,952 entries.
