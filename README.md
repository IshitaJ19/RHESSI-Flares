# Analysis of Solar Flares from RHESSI Mission

Data Source: https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessidata/dbase/hessi_flare_list.txt

A solar flare is a sudden powerful burst of energy on the Sunâ€™s surface, often accompanied by Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).

To explore the basic physics of particle acceleration and explosive energy release in solar flares, NASA mission RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) was launched on February 5, 2002, and recorded over 120,000 flare-related events before being decomissioned on August 16, 2018.

The cleaned data frame has 39,952 entries.

This project is done as part of DATS6103 - Introduction to Data Mining at The George Washington University.
